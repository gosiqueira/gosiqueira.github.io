Welcome to my blog! This is the first publication that I'm posting in here but there's no much to say yet. So I decided that this first post is devoted to telling you guys why I created this blog page.

2020 social isolation due to COVID-19 pandemics made me rethink how I'm interacting with people in my professional area and the hard truth is, I'm not interacting with people at all. Of course, I have my teammates in the research laboratory that I'm currently working on, but that's all.

My friends from digital marketing always repeat the same sentence: "Networking worths more than money." I agree with them so hard that I focused the last year to expand my networking cycle. However, physical boundaries were still a limitation to expand my contacts list. I met many people wich influenced my mindset in manners that brought me here, but if I want to make the world see what I'm working on, there's nowhere else I could go but the internet.

So here I am. If you want to know more about who I am, please visit the [about](gosiqueira.github.io/about/) section. Any suggestions or questions, feel free to contact me at one of the links I provided on the home page.

See you next time.
