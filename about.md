Hi. I am **Gustavo Siqueira**. I'm a 26-years-old Brazilian programmer. Currently, I'm working towards obtaining my Computer Science Ph.D. title at **Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG), Brazil**. My main interests concern of Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Information Retrieval, and Data Science.

My story in the tech world began in my childhood, when I was 5 years old, my father's old computer, which I can't even remember detailed information, with its Windows-95 was used by me in DOS mode to navigate access classic games like **[Blizzard Lost Vikings](https://www.blizzard.com/pt-br/download/confirmation?platform=windows&locale=pt_BR&product=tlv)**. I still remember how my father used to ask me to close everything and reopen in front of his friends to show how I was familiar with operating system commands.

Time passed and I started to look after more complex games and devoted the end of my childhood mastering **Super Nintendo** and **PlayStation** consoles. By that time we also upgraded to a slightly better computer with Windows-98 and started to use dial-up internet connection. Once in a while, my parents let me spend some time during the Sundays browsing for online games.

Only after we moved to a country town, where my mother's family resides, I turned back my interest in computers again. My mother's youngest brother influenced me a lot when it comes to games tastes. He started to play **[Microsoft Age of Empires](https://www.ageofempires.com/)** and I was fascinated by the game mechanics. However, my current PC at that time wasn't good enough to play it. I bothered my parents for as much time as I could to upgrade our PC using the excuse that it would be good for me in my school studies. Oh, I forgot to tell you that meanwhile, I was trying to get a better PC a tried to format our old Windows-98 to install Windows XP and lost some of my father's important files. That cost me three months without using the PC, except for school assignments.

Internet became more popular and everyone started to have an **MSN Messenger** or an **Orkut profile**. Unfortunately, I was still using that slow dial-up connection. Only when my father returned to study did I have access to an **ADSL** connection. By that time, as teenagers, my friends and I were starting to look after things beyond social networking or playing games. I discovered the basics of programming and how to hack some small stuff like freezing an e-mail account using one script we downloaded from one of those hackers community sites.

Finishing elementary school I had an important decision to make: where I would study in my high school. Turns out that technician schools were extremely hyped at that time and I was pretty sure I wanted something related to technology. That's when I started my career as a programmer. In 2009, I was approved in the local technician school **CEFET/Campus Itabirito**, current **[IFMG Itabirito](https://www.ifmg.edu.br/itabirito)**, where I acquired my title as a technician in industrial computing. My experience as a programmer during these three years wasn't exactly what I expected. Many of the things that I learned were related to automation in industries or digital systems using chipsets. I was way more interested in software development. The little contact that I had to **C language** and **web development** kept me motivated to follow the area in my graduation course.

In 2012, I finally started my **B.Sc. Computer Science** course at **Federal University of Ouro Preto (UFOP), Brazil**.
